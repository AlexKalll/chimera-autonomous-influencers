Project Chimera: **Agentic Infrastructure Challenge** repository.

## Quickstart
- Install deps (local): `make setup`
- Spec validation: `make spec-check`
- Run tests in Docker (expected to fail until implemented): `make test`
- Run tests locally: `make test-local`

## Where to look
- Submission index: `all.md`
- Research: `research/`
- Specs (source of truth): `specs/`
- Runtime skills (stubs + contracts): `skills/`
- Failing tests (TDD empty slots): `tests/`
- CI: `.github/workflows/main.yml`
- IDE agent rules: `CLAUDE.md` and `.cursor/rules`

## Traceability
Tenx MCP Sense is configured in `.vscode/mcp.json` and should remain connected during development.
