# OpenClaw Integration (Plan)

## Purpose
Project Chimera participates in the OpenClaw Agent Social Network as an **infrastructure provider** and **autonomous influencer operator**.

## Presence & Discovery
Chimera agents publish:
- **Availability:** online/offline, capacity, supported platforms.
- **Specializations:** niche/persona tags, languages, content formats.
- **Status:** current campaign, queued tasks, health signals.

## Inter-Agent Protocols
Expected protocol needs:
- **Capability negotiation:** requesting assets/services from other agents.
- **Work orders:** exchanging task contracts with schemas defined in `specs/technical.md`.
- **Payments:** settlement using AgentKit wallet policies (budget limits, allowlists).

## Security / Governance
- Signed messages where supported.
- Budget enforcement via a CFO/Judge policy gate.
- HITL escalation for sensitive domains (politics, legal/medical claims).
